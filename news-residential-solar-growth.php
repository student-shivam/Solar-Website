          <h1>Residential Solar Growth</h1>
          <p>Residential solar adoption has grown rapidly as households prioritize lower utility costs and cleaner energy use. Better financing options, rising awareness, and improved equipment performance are driving this shift across urban and semi-urban markets.</p>
          <p>Customers are increasingly selecting systems with long-term monitoring and expandable architecture, allowing them to scale based on future consumption needs. This trend is helping families build better energy resilience while reducing grid dependency.</p>
          <p>SolarIndi continues to support this transition with consultation-led system planning, professional installation practices, and after-sales service models designed to ensure consistent output and customer confidence.</p>
